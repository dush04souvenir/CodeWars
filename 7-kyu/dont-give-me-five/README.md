The start and the end number are both inclusive!</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><pre><code>1,9 -&gt; 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -&gt; Result 84,17 -&gt; 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -&gt; Result 12</code></pre><p>The result may contain fives. ;-)<br>The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!</p><p>I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.</p><p>Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) </p><p>I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!</p>
