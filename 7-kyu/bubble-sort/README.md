Your task is to implement a Bubble sort (for some help look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort</a>) and return a list of snapshots after <strong>each change</strong> of the initial list.</p><p>e.g. </p><p>If the initial list would be l=[1,2,4,3] my algorithm rotates l[2] and l[3] and after that it adds [1,2,3,4] to the result, which is a list of snapshots.</p><pre><code>[1,2,4,3] should return [ [1,2,3,4] ][2,1,4,3] should return [ [1,2,4,3], [1,2,3,4] ][1,2,3,4] should return []</code></pre>
